# Odysseus Setup Guide

This page keeps the detailed install, deployment, troubleshooting, and configuration notes out of the front README.

## Quick Start

> **Branch note:** `dev` is the default branch and contains the latest development changes, but it may be unstable. For the more stable curated branch, use [`main`](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/tree/main).

Defaults work out of the box: clone, run, then configure models/search/email
inside **Settings**. Only edit `.env` for deployment-level overrides like
`APP_BIND`, `APP_PORT`, `AUTH_ENABLED`, `DATABASE_URL`, or a pre-seeded admin password.

On first setup, Odysseus creates an admin account (`admin` unless
`ODYSSEUS_ADMIN_USER` is set) and prints a temporary password in the terminal.
Use that for the first login, then change it in **Settings**.

### Native macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7000
```
Requirements: Python 3.11+. Cookbook also needs `tmux` for background model
downloads and serves. The app itself is lightweight; local model serving is the
heavy part and depends on the model, runtime, GPU, and VRAM, so small hosts can
connect to API or remote model servers instead. Use `--host 0.0.0.0` only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.

### Apple Silicon
For GPU-accelerated Cookbook on an M-series Mac, run Odysseus natively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
./start-macos.sh
```

It launches at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. To expose it to your phone over a trusted LAN/VPN such as Tailscale, bind all interfaces:

```bash
ODYSSEUS_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./start-macos.sh
# then open http://<tailscale-ip>:7860
```

The script also reads `.env` at startup, so `APP_BIND=0.0.0.0` and `APP_PORT`
set there are picked up automatically without a command-line override each run.

Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` (the default) before binding outside loopback. Do not
expose this port directly to the public internet. To build a clickable app wrapper:

```bash
./build-macos-app.sh
```

**Remote servers.** In **Cookbook -> Settings -> Servers**, generate the
Odysseus SSH key and add the public key to the remote server's
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. From the host you can also run:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i data/ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```

**Ollama.** If Ollama runs locally, add this endpoint in Settings:

```text
http://localhost:11434/v1
```

Ollama must listen outside its own loopback interface:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

**macOS details.** `start-macos.sh` installs Homebrew deps, creates the venv,
runs setup, and starts uvicorn on port `7860` because AirPlay often holds
`7000`. It uses llama.cpp/Ollama for Metal. vLLM/SGLang are CUDA/ROCm-only and
do not run on macOS. MLX-only models are not served by Odysseus.

## Troubleshooting & Advanced Setup

### `chromadb-client` conflicts with embedded ChromaDB
If `chromadb-client` (the lightweight HTTP-only package) is installed alongside the full `chromadb` package, Odysseus starts but ChromaDB silently falls back to HTTP-only mode and fails.

**Fix:** uninstall `chromadb-client` and force-reinstall the full package:
```bash
./venv/bin/pip uninstall chromadb-client -y
./venv/bin/pip install --force-reinstall chromadb
```

### HTTPS + LAN/Tailscale exposure
To expose Odysseus on a local network or Tailscale with HTTPS:
1. Change the bind address to `0.0.0.0` in `.env` (`APP_BIND=0.0.0.0` or `ODYSSEUS_HOST=0.0.0.0`).
2. Generate a locally-trusted cert for your LAN/Tailscale IPs using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file key.pem 192.168.1.100 tailscale-ip
   ```
3. Run `uvicorn` with the generated certs:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000 --ssl-certfile=cert.pem --ssl-keyfile=key.pem
   ```
4. Install the `mkcert` CA on any other device you want to access Odysseus from (e.g., for iOS, email the `rootCA.pem` to yourself, install the profile, and trust it in Certificate Trust Settings).

### Optional Dependencies
`requirements-optional.txt` contains packages that unlock extra features. It is not installed by default.

| Package | Feature unlocked |
|---------|-----------------|
| `faster-whisper` | Local speech-to-text (microphone -> text) via the "local" STT provider. |
| `ddgs` | DuckDuckGo as a search provider option. |
| `PyMuPDF` | PDF page rendering in the side viewer panel and form-filling. (Note: AGPL-3.0) |
| `markitdown` | Office/EPUB document text extraction (converts .docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.xls/.epub to Markdown). |

### Faster, reproducible installs with uv (optional)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) works as a drop-in replacement for the
venv + pip steps in the native install guides, no project changes are needed but this change results in faster installs along with a lockfile for reproducible environments. After [installing `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), use:

```bash
uv venv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# then continue as usual: python setup.py, uvicorn, ...
```

`requirements.txt` is intentionally unpinned, so two installs at different times can produce different package versions. If you want a reproducible environment (e.g. across your own machines, or to roll back after a bad upgrade), snapshot and restore exact versions with:

```bash
uv pip compile requirements.txt -o requirements.lock   # snapshot current resolution
uv pip sync requirements.lock                          # reproduce it exactly later
```

`requirements.lock` is gitignored and platform-specific (compile it on the OS you deploy to). Regenerate it deliberately when you want to take upgrades. The plain `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` keeps following the unpinned requirements like pip does.

### Outlook / Office 365 email
Odysseus email accounts currently use IMAP/SMTP username-password auth. Outlook
and Microsoft 365 generally require OAuth instead, so normal Microsoft mailbox
passwords will fail. See [docs/email-outlook.md](docs/email-outlook.md) for the
current limitation and the planned integration direction.

## Security Notes
Odysseus is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools: shell access, file uploads, model downloads, web research, email/calendar integrations, and API tokens. Treat it like an admin console.

- Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` for any network-accessible deployment.
- Keep `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false` outside local development.
- Use `SECURE_COOKIES=true` when Odysseus is served through HTTPS by a trusted reverse proxy or private access gateway.
- Do not expose it directly to the public internet without HTTPS and a trusted reverse proxy or private access layer.
- Keep `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, databases, uploads, generated media, backups, auth/session files, API keys, and model/provider tokens out of Git and private shares. They are ignored by default.
- Review `data/auth.json` after first boot: disable open signup unless you intentionally want it, make only your own account admin, and keep demo/test accounts non-admin.
- Non-admin users do not get shell/Python/file read/write by default, and admin-only routes/tools such as MCP management, API tokens, webhooks, model/cookbook serving, backup/vault, and app settings are admin-gated. Other features are controlled by per-user privileges, so review each user's privileges before exposing a deployment.
- Rotate any API keys or tokens that were ever pasted into a shared chat, demo, screenshot, or log.
- If you enable API tokens or webhooks, create separate tokens per integration and delete unused ones.
- Prefer binding manual development runs to `127.0.0.1`; bind to `0.0.0.0` only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.
- Keep ChromaDB, SearXNG, ntfy, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, databases, and raw model/provider APIs internal-only. Expose only the authenticated Odysseus web/API entrypoint through your trusted proxy or private access layer.
- Before publishing a fork, run `git status --short` and confirm no private files from `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, uploads, backups, or local databases are staged.

### Private or proxied deployments
Odysseus serves plain HTTP on its app port. A typical production/private setup is:

1. Keep Odysseus on localhost, for example `127.0.0.1:7000`.
2. Terminate HTTPS at a trusted reverse proxy or private access gateway.
3. Put the authenticated Odysseus web/API entrypoint behind that layer.
4. Keep raw service and model ports internal-only.

Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, Caddy, nginx, and Traefik can all fit this pattern; none are required by Odysseus. If your access layer reaches Odysseus on the same host, proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:7000` and keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false`, and `SECURE_COOKIES=true`.
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists exact permitted origins for cross-origin browser/API clients; ordinary same-origin reverse-proxy access usually does not need a special CORS entry.

Common internal-only ports from the default setup:

| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| `7000` | Odysseus raw app port |
| `8080` | SearXNG |
| `8091` | ntfy |
| `8100` | ChromaDB host port |
| `11434` | Ollama |
| `8000-8020` | Common local model/provider APIs |

## Configuration
Most setup is done inside the app with `/setup` or **Settings**. Use `.env`
for deployment-level defaults and secrets you want present before first boot.
Key settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_HOST` | `localhost` | Your LLM server (e.g. `llm-host.local:8000`) |
| `LLM_HOSTS` | -- | Comma-separated list for model discovery |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | -- | Optional OpenAI key. Prefer adding providers in the app unless pre-seeding. |
| `SEARXNG_INSTANCE` | `http://localhost:8080` | SearXNG URL. |
| `SEARXNG_SECRET` | generated on first boot | Optional SearXNG cookie/CSRF secret. Leave blank unless you need to pin it. |
| `APP_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Host bind address for the web UI. Use `0.0.0.0` only for intentional LAN/reverse-proxy access. |
| `APP_PORT` | `7000` | Host port for the web UI. |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Host directory for application data volumes. |
| `APP_LOGS_DIR` | `./logs` | Host directory for application logs. |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable login |
| `LOCALHOST_BYPASS` | `false` | Development-only auth bypass for loopback requests. Keep false for shared/network deployments. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated exact permitted origins for cross-origin browser/API clients. |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set true when serving Odysseus through HTTPS at a trusted proxy or private access gateway. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/app.db` | Database connection string |
| `CHROMADB_HOST` | `localhost` | ChromaDB host for vector memory. |
| `CHROMADB_PORT` | `8100` | ChromaDB port. |
| `EMBEDDING_URL` | -- | OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint |
| `ODYSSEUS_CHAT_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` | Chat/agent attachment cap in bytes. Raise for larger local PDFs or text documents. |
| `ODYSSEUS_GALLERY_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `104857600` | Gallery image upload cap in bytes (100 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_GALLERY_TRANSFORM_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `26214400` | Gallery transform input cap in bytes (25 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_MEMORY_IMPORT_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` | Memory import file cap in bytes (10 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_PERSONAL_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `26214400` | Personal document upload cap in bytes (25 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_EMAIL_COMPOSE_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `26214400` | Email compose attachment cap in bytes (25 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_STT_MAX_AUDIO_BYTES` | `26214400` | Speech-to-text audio cap in bytes (25 MB). |
| `ODYSSEUS_ICS_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` | Calendar `.ics` import cap in bytes (10 MB). |

All upload-limit vars are validated (must be a positive integer) and optional; an invalid value fails fast at startup.

### Built-in MCP servers (optional setup)

Odysseus auto-registers a few built-in MCP servers at startup. The npx-based ones (currently the browser server, `@playwright/mcp`) only start when their npm package is already in the local npx cache. If a package isn't cached, that server is skipped with a startup log message explaining what to do, so a fresh install does not block on a multi-minute npm download or hang if Playwright system deps are missing.

To enable the browser MCP (page navigation, screenshots, vision), run once:

```bash
npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --version
```

That installs `@playwright/mcp` plus Playwright (~300MB total). Restart Odysseus and the server will register at startup.

## Data
All user data lives in `data/` (gitignored): `app.db` (sessions, messages, documents),
`memory.json`, `presets.json`, `uploads/`, `personal_docs/`, `chroma/`, `settings.json`.

To back up or restore everything in `data/`, see the
[Backup & Restore guide](docs/backup-restore.md).
